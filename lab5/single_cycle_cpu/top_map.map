ERROR:Pack:2309 - Too many bonded comps of type "IOB" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices reported may not be reflected accurately as
   their packing might not have been completed.

      Number using O6 output only:             429
      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                  567
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                      32 out of   2,176    1%
      Number used as Dual Port RAM:              0
      Number used as Single Port RAM:           32
        Number using O6 output only:            32
        Number using O5 output only:             0
        Number using O5 and O6:                  0
      Number used as Shift Register:             0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        56 out of   4,556    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        1,093
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           446 out of   1,093   40%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  65 out of   1,093    5%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         582 out of   1,093   53%
    Number of unique control sets:              12
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              41 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                       286 out of     232  123% (OVERMAPPED)
    IOB Latches:                                53
