Simulator is doing circuit initialization process.
 Block Memory Generator CORE Generator module loading initial data...
 Block Memory Generator data initialization complete.
Block Memory Generator CORE Generator module testtop.uut.Myram.inst.\native_mem_mapped_module.blk_mem_gen_v7_3_inst  is using a behavioral model for simulation which will not precisely model memory collision behavior.
Finished circuit initialization process.
