  Number of Slice LUTs:                      2,463 out of   9,112   27%
    Number used as logic:                    2,463 out of   9,112   27%
      Number using O6 output only:           1,944
      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                  519
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   2,176    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   904 out of   2,278   39%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        32 out of   4,556    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        2,468
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,878 out of   2,468   76%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   5 out of   2,468    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         585 out of   2,468   23%
    Number of unique control sets:               4
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              13 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
